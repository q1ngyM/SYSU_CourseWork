This is the 2nd Lab Work of DS with the requirements of:

* Select your own dataset and specify the data source.
  * I obtained a dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset](), which contains 55,500 simulated real patient medical condition records.
* Use NLP tools (e.g., spaCy) to extract entities and relations.
* Build a knowledge graph with Neo4j and visualize key nodes.
